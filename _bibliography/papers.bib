  abstract   = {Virtual wind tunnel testing is a key ingredient in the engineering design process for the automotive and aeronautical industries as well as for urban planning: through visualization and analysis of the simulation data, it helps optimize lift and drag coefficients, increase peak speed, detect high pressure zones, and reduce wind noise at low cost prior to manufacturing. In this paper, we develop an efficient and accurate virtual wind tunnel system based on recent contributions from both computer graphics and computational fluid dynamics in high-performance kinetic solvers. Running on one or multiple GPUs, our massively-parallel lattice Boltzmann model meets industry standards for accuracy and consistency while exceeding current mainstream industrial solutions in terms of efficiency --- especially for unsteady turbulent flow simulation at very high Reynolds number (on the order of 107) --- due to key contributions in improved collision modeling and boundary treatment, automatic construction of multiresolution grids for complex models, as well as performance optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of our virtual wind tunnel testing facility through comparisons of our results to multiple benchmark tests, showing an increase in both accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art industrial solutions. We also illustrate the fine turbulence structures that our system can capture, indicating the relevance of our solver for both VFX and industrial product design.},

  abstract   = {The intricate motions and complex vortical structures generated by the interaction between fluids and solids are visually fascinating. However, reproducing such a two-way coupling between thin objects and turbulent fluids numerically is notoriously challenging and computationally costly: existing approaches such as cut-cell or immersed-boundary methods have difficulty achieving physical accuracy, or even visual plausibility, of simulations involving fast-evolving flows with immersed objects of arbitrary shapes. In this paper, we propose an efficient and versatile approach for simulating two-way fluid-solid coupling within the kinetic (lattice-Boltzmann) fluid simulation framework, valid for both laminar and highly turbulent flows, and for both thick and thin objects. We introduce a novel hybrid approach to fluid-solid coupling which systematically involves a mesoscopic double-sided bounce-back scheme followed by a cut-cell velocity correction for a more robust and plausible treatment of turbulent flows near moving (thin) solids, preventing flow penetration and reducing boundary artifacts significantly. Coupled with an efficient approximation to simplify geometric computations, the whole boundary treatment method preserves the inherent massively parallel computational nature of the kinetic method. Moreover, we propose simple GPU optimizations of the core LBM algorithm which achieve an even higher computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art kinetic fluid solvers in graphics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of our two-way coupling through various challenging simulations involving a variety of rigid body solids and fluids at both high and low Reynolds numbers. Finally, comparisons to existing methods on benchmark data and real experiments further highlight the superiority of our method.},
